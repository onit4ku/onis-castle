# Oni's Castle
Platformer 2D Engine project

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

At the moment, the sprites used are Open art and free to use, except the turret and a fat soldier.
This is a 2D Platformer engine that I have been developing until now, 
with which I am discovering how to develop with Unity and which could be used for the development of different games in 2d.

There are several known bugs and it is in a state of early development.
